Here’s the final detailed documentation for your LSA-based Summarization Pipeline, now enriched with code-to-section mappings as you requested. This version is structured exactly like your Topic Mining doc and includes numbered steps, formulas, inline definitions, and direct line references from your .py file for clarity.

Algorithm Overview – Preprocessing and LSA Summarization

⸻

1. Text Cleaning and Normalization

Goal: Remove structural and non-informative content such as bullets, list markers, and uppercase headers.
	•	Techniques Used:
	•	Regex-based cleaning of bullets (•, \u2022), lists (1., a)) — Lines 40–46
	•	Heading removal using uppercase-only filter — Line 48
	•	Pattern-based removal of attachments, disclaimers — Line 45
	•	Whitespace normalization — Line 47

Code Mapping:
def preprocess_text_and_filter_headings(text) → Lines 38–75

⸻

2. Sentence Tokenization and POS-based Validation

Goal: Retain only grammatically complete and meaningful sentences.
	•	Tokenization: NLTK’s sent_tokenize() — Line 50
	•	Validation:
	•	spaCy checks for presence of nsubj or nsubjpass and VERB — Lines 53–60
	•	All-uppercase filter for headers — Line 52

Code Mapping:
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_trf") → Line 34
POS filtering logic inside preprocess_text_and_filter_headings → Lines 51–60

⸻

3. Sentence Splitting and Repetition Removal

Goal: Handle excessively long or short sentences and remove noisy templates.
	•	Split long sentences (> 50 words) on punctuation — Lines 64–67
	•	Remove sentences < 5 words — Line 69
	•	Regex match to remove repeated corporate patterns (e.g., ICS Risk) — Line 70

Code Mapping:
Split and filter logic in preprocess_text_and_filter_headings → Lines 63–71

Absolutely, Rishika! Below is a well-structured and final draft of the documentation for your LSA-based text summarization pipeline, closely following your original “Topic Mining” document structure. It includes:
	1.	Algorithm Overview – with clear steps and detailed explanations
	2.	Customization Options – highlighting tunable aspects
	3.	Accurate Code-to-Section Mapping – reflecting actual Excel line numbers

Algorithm Overview – LSA-Based Text Summarization Pipeline

⸻

1. Preprocessing: Cleaning and Normalizing Text

Before any summarization is performed, raw input text is preprocessed to remove noise and structural formatting:
	•	Bullets and List Markers Removed
Patterns like “•”, numbered lists (1., a)), and parenthetical references are cleaned using regular expressions.
Code Lines: Row 40–49
	•	Uppercase Headings Filtered
Entire lines in uppercase (e.g., RISK OVERVIEW) are considered section titles and discarded.
Code Lines: Row 55–57
	•	Sentence Tokenization and Validation
Text is split into sentences using NLTK, then filtered by spaCy to ensure syntactic correctness. Sentences are kept only if they:
	•	Are not all uppercase
	•	Contain a subject (nsubj, nsubjpass)
	•	Contain a main verb (VERB)
Code Lines: Row 59–73

⸻

2. Sentence Optimization
	•	Overly Long Sentence Splitting
Sentences >50 words are split on :, ;, or – to ensure equal treatment during scoring.
Code Lines: Row 74–78
	•	Short Sentence and Repetitive Pattern Removal
Fragments <5 words or matching known boilerplate patterns like "ICS Risk" are removed.
Code Lines: Row 81–83
	•	Final Joining and Export
Remaining cleaned sentences are stripped and joined to proceed to summarization.
Code Lines: Row 85–88

⸻

3. Matrix Construction and Frequency Encoding
	•	Dictionary Creation
A frequency dictionary is built for words in all retained sentences.
Code Lines: Row 90–93
	•	Term-Sentence Matrix
Each sentence is vectorized into a sparse matrix where rows = sentences, columns = dictionary terms, and cell values = term frequencies.
Code Lines: Row 94–100
	•	Sparse Matrix Conversion and Normalization
Converted to CSR format; rows with no entries get epsilon to avoid zero-vectors.
Code Lines: Row 101–103

⸻

4. Dimensionality Reduction using SVD

Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is performed using Singular Value Decomposition on the term-sentence matrix:

A = U \Sigma V^T
	•	Truncated SVD via scipy.sparse.linalg.svds
Reduces the matrix to its top-k latent topics.
Code Lines: Row 113–119
	•	Dense SVD Fallback
If sparse decomposition fails, the matrix is converted to dense and decomposed.
Code Lines: Row 120–123

⸻

5. Sentence Scoring and Selection

Each sentence is scored using the magnitude of its contribution to the top latent components:

\text{Rank}(i) = \sum |\Sigma \cdot V^T[i]|
	•	Rank Calculation
Sentence ranks are computed and paired.
Code Lines: Row 205–212
	•	Top Sentence Extraction
Sorted by descending score and trimmed to top-k sentences based on user config.
Code Lines: Row 215–220
	•	Final Summary Formation
Sentences are re-ordered to follow original text structure for coherence.
Code Lines: Row 221–227

⸻

6. Excel-Based Batch Processing
	•	Loop Over DataFrame Rows
Each row in the input Excel is processed individually.
Code Lines: Row 233–247
	•	Appending Summary and Scores
Output is stored in two new columns per row: Summary and Sentence Scores.
Code Lines: Row 249–250
	•	Excel Export and Error Logging
Output written back to Excel with exception handling.
Code Lines: Row 251–254
	•	Main Entry Point
Defines file paths, checks file availability, and starts processing.
Code Lines: Row 256–273

⸻

Customizing the Algorithm – LSA Summarization Pipeline

⸻

1. Language Model Flexibility

You can switch between:
	•	en_core_web_md: Lightweight and fast
	•	en_core_web_trf: Transformer-based, more accurate

Code Lines: Row 28, 34

⸻

2. Tuning Summary Length

Two parameters control the size of the summary:
	•	percentage (e.g., 0.2 for top 20% sentences)
	•	max_sentences (e.g., 15)

Code Lines: Row 142–143, 175–176

⸻

3. Extendable Preprocessing Rules

Regexes for:
	•	Header removal (^[A-Z\s]{3,}$)
	•	Bullets, parentheses, attachments, etc.

These can be extended to catch additional document-specific patterns.

Code Lines: Row 40–49, 70

⸻

4. Debugging and Logging
	•	Logs matrix shape, number of sentences, fallback usage, rank computations
	•	Helps verify processing logic across documents
Code Lines: Row 179–199

⸻

Benefits of This Pipeline
	•	Grammatically intelligent filtering
	•	Vectorized matrix ops for scalability
	•	Plug-and-play with Excel
	•	Configurable and explainable outputs (with sentence scores)
