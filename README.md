Here’s the final detailed documentation for your LSA-based Summarization Pipeline, now enriched with code-to-section mappings as you requested. This version is structured exactly like your Topic Mining doc and includes numbered steps, formulas, inline definitions, and direct line references from your .py file for clarity.

Algorithm Overview – Preprocessing and LSA Summarization

⸻

1. Text Cleaning and Normalization

Goal: Remove structural and non-informative content such as bullets, list markers, and uppercase headers.
	•	Techniques Used:
	•	Regex-based cleaning of bullets (•, \u2022), lists (1., a)) — Lines 40–46
	•	Heading removal using uppercase-only filter — Line 48
	•	Pattern-based removal of attachments, disclaimers — Line 45
	•	Whitespace normalization — Line 47

Code Mapping:
def preprocess_text_and_filter_headings(text) → Lines 38–75

⸻

2. Sentence Tokenization and POS-based Validation

Goal: Retain only grammatically complete and meaningful sentences.
	•	Tokenization: NLTK’s sent_tokenize() — Line 50
	•	Validation:
	•	spaCy checks for presence of nsubj or nsubjpass and VERB — Lines 53–60
	•	All-uppercase filter for headers — Line 52

Code Mapping:
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_trf") → Line 34
POS filtering logic inside preprocess_text_and_filter_headings → Lines 51–60

⸻

3. Sentence Splitting and Repetition Removal

Goal: Handle excessively long or short sentences and remove noisy templates.
	•	Split long sentences (> 50 words) on punctuation — Lines 64–67
	•	Remove sentences < 5 words — Line 69
	•	Regex match to remove repeated corporate patterns (e.g., ICS Risk) — Line 70

Code Mapping:
Split and filter logic in preprocess_text_and_filter_headings → Lines 63–71

⸻

4. Term-Sentence Matrix Construction

Goal: Build a numerical representation of term frequency across sentences.
	•	Matrix type: lil_matrix (converted to csr_matrix) — Line 96
	•	Sentence-word frequency population — Lines 91–94
	•	Epsilon correction if row is empty — Lines 98–102

Formula:
\text{TF}_{i,j} = \text{count of term } j \text{ in sentence } i

Code Mapping:
_create_matrix method in OptimizedLSASummarizer → Lines 89–104

⸻

5. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

Goal: Reduce dimensionality and identify latent semantic relationships.
	•	Default: Truncated SVD using svds — Line 114
	•	Fallback: Dense SVD using np.linalg.svd() — Lines 116–119

Formula:
\mathbf{A} = U \Sigma V^T

Code Mapping:
_compute_svd method → Lines 112–121

⸻

6. Sentence Scoring and Ranking

Goal: Score sentences based on topic vector magnitude.
	•	Rank computation using singular vectors:
\text{Rank}(i) = \sum |\Sigma \cdot V^T[i]|
	•	Sentence-score tuples are formed — Lines 130–133
	•	Sorted and original order preserved — Lines 134–136

Code Mapping:
_compute_ranks method → Lines 108–110
Ranking logic in __call__() and summarize_paragraph() → Lines 124–138, 142–163

⸻

7. Batch Processing and Excel Output

Goal: Process each row from Excel and append results.
	•	Input/Output from .xlsx file — Lines 168–174
	•	Row-wise processing with process_dataframe() — Lines 164–166
	•	Logs generated per row with status — Lines 158–160
	•	Final summary and scores written to new columns — Lines 162–163

Code Mapping:
process_dataframe() → Lines 156–166
main() entry point — Lines 176–183

⸻

Customizing the Algorithm – LSA Pipeline

⸻

1. Language Model Configuration

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_md")  # Lightweight
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_trf")  # Transformer-based

Line 34

⸻

2. Adjustable Summary Length
	•	percentage=0.2 → top 20% of sentences
	•	max_sentences=15 → absolute upper limit

Line 142

⸻

3. Extendable Regex Patterns
	•	To remove new uppercase headings or repeated phrases.
	•	Modify regex in Lines 41–48, 70 as needed.

⸻

Example Input & Output

Input Text (Excel)	Output Summary	Sentence Scores
“The ICS Risk framework…”	“The ICS framework ensures early identification…”	[0.42, 0.36, 0.31]


⸻

Efficient Handling Highlights
	•	Sparse matrix ops (csr_matrix) for fast SVD
	•	Logging at every stage:
	•	Sentence count, matrix stats, fallback triggers
	•	Useful for debugging model behavior on large datasets

⸻

Benefits of the Optimized Pipeline
	•	Linguistically filtered inputs ensure quality.
	•	Vectorized and scalable.
	•	Summary + interpretability (score tuples).
	•	Ideal for real-world, long-text documents.
	•	Fully Excel-compatible.
